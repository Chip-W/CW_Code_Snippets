THIS SCRIPT ADD FUEL POINTS AT ALL POLICE STATIONS THAT CAN ONLY BE USED BY ANY VEHICLE WITH THE "FLAG_LAW_ENFORCEMENT"
IN THE VEHICLES.META FILE. <BR><BR>

THESE VEHICLES CAN STILL FUEL AT REGULAR STATIONS.<BR><bR>

I'VE INCLUDED A YMAP FILE THAT PUTS PUMPS AT ALL THE POLICE/FIRE FUEL LOCATIONS<BR><BR>

ISSUES:<BR>
FIRE, AMBULANCE, AND RIOT VEHICLES CAN NOT USE THESE FUEL POINTS UNLESS YOU EDIT THE VEHICLES.META AND ADD THE
"FLAG_LAW_ENFORCEMENT" FLAG.  THIS IS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND A COMMON NATIVE.<BR><BR>

POLICE PUMPS STILL CHARGE YOU (I HAVEN'T FIGURED THIS OUT YET).<BR><bR>

NAMES ABOVE THE PUMPS DON'T WORK AS THERE APPEARS TO BE A HARD LIMIT TO HOW MANY CAN IN AN ARRAY
